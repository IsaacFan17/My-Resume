<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hello from Wenlong! Thank you for taking your time reading my profile. </p>
  
<p>I used to think how I can make my photos to be seen by more people and then I realized I should post them on the internet. But then, when I came to the social media, I felt it's easy to post but hard to follow as it's manipulated by the companies themselves. They make the rules. There I had my initial thought of building my own website. </p>
<p>As you can see, I'm just a junior in the process of web developing. And it's undoubtful that there's a long way for me to go in the future. However, writing codes and making it seen by people can be a dream come true to me. So I really appreciate you being here no matter what takes you here.</p>

<p>Let me introduce myself again. <br />
  I'm a web developer, <br />
  a photographer, <br />
  and a lifelong learner.</p>
